== 3.0.1 == 19/02/2013
 - Fixed some bugs in unisolve that caused early exists
   without full approximation of some roots. 
 - Correction in the Octave module to ease compilation
   on all targets. 
 - Corrected a bug in the floating point shift
 - Slight optimizations on algorithm MPS_ALGORITHM_SECULAR_GA.
 - Corrections in the Matlab (TM) module.
