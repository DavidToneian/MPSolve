The main theoretical results behind MPSolve can be found in the paper "<i>Design,
Analysis, and Implementation of a Multiprecision Polynomial Rootfinder</i>"
by D. A. Bini and G. Fiorentino published in Numerical Algorithms, Volume
23 (2000), pages 127-173.

<font color="#0000FF">Install</font></h2></center>
MPSolve requires a GNU compatible "<tt>make</tt>" and C compiler (<tt>gcc</tt>)
which are standard in any linux distribution and are&nbsp; available on
most platforms. It also requires that the GMP multiprecision package
has been correctly installed and that both the header file "<tt>gmp.h</tt>"
and the library file "<tt>libgmp.a</tt>" can be accessed by <tt>gcc</tt>.
These files can also be copied to the Gmp subdirectory once the GMP package
has been successfully configured and compiled.
<p>MPSolve does not include the GMP package that can be downloaded from
the URL <a href="http://www.swox.com/gmp/">http://www.swox.com/gmp/</a>.
<p>The package has been developed and fully tested with GMP versions 2.0.2
and 3.1.1; however, the former contains some known bugs which may lead to
slow&nbsp; and badly formatted outputs. These errors can be fixed by applying
some patches which can be downloaded from the above URL.
<p>In order to create the executable file (<tt>unisolve</tt>) simply type:
<blockquote><b><tt>make</tt></b></blockquote>
in the MPSolve directory. After a successful compilation, all unneeded
object files and libraries can be removed by issuing:
<blockquote><b><tt>make clean</tt></b></blockquote>
Finally, the executable file can be tested with the command:
<blockquote><b><tt>make check</tt></b></blockquote>
which invokes unisolve on a simple polynomial.

<font color="#0000FF">Usage</font></h2></center>
MPSolve takes all of its input from the command line and the standard input,
to run the program, type:
<blockquote><b><tt>unisolve <i>options</i> <i>input_file</i></tt></b></blockquote>
where <b><i><tt>input_file</tt></i></b> is the name of the file holding
the input polynomial (see the <a href="input.htm">input format</a> page)
and <b><i><tt>options</tt></i></b> is the list of options and directives
such as the goal of the computation, the requested output precision, the
subset of the complex plane where the roots are sought and many others
(see the <a href="options.htm">options</a> page).
<p>If the <b><i><tt>input_file</tt></i></b> is missing then unisolve will
read from&nbsp; the standard input stream (typically the keyboard).
<p>The output format is ruled by some command line options and follows
some conventions (see the <a href="output.htm">output conventions</a> page).
